Here are a few weekend project ideas:

1. Build a small herb garden
2. Create a photo collage of your favorite memories
3. Learn to bake bread from scratch

Those are interesting ideas. Some considerations:

- Herb garden: Requires some space and sunlight
- Photo collage: Need to have photos ready or time to print them
- Bread baking: Will need specific ingredients and equipment

For the herb garden idea:

Materials needed:

- Small pots or containers
- Potting soil
- Herb seeds or seedlings (basil, mint, parsley)
- Watering can

Steps:

1. Fill containers with soil
2. Plant seeds according to package directions
3. Water gently
4. Place in sunny location
5. Water regularly
